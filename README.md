# Eventure


Eventure is an app to meet new people. It could be used as a dating app or just to make new friends. Rather than matching people together, however, you will choose activities. The app will list activities and the users will be able to join activities that interest them, thus matching with people with the same interests.


## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable


For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Ever want to do something but have no one to do it with? Eventure (event + adventure) is an app to put you in touch with people who like doing the same things as you. Simply pick an activity you want to do and the app will match you with someone else who picked that activity!

### Design

The user will sign in with their full name, their email, and a password.

The user will see a screen with all the activities and will be able to join one.

After joining a group, the user will see the names and emails of the other people in their group to get in contact with.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Three different screens. Login/Register, joining an activty, and the group information after you've joined.
- **CSS** - Good looking display, with colored buttons and good whitespace usage.
- **React** - Provides login, changes fill number when joined, changes join button to full, allows user to join and leave group.
- **Service** - Endpoints for:
    - login
    - register
    - joining activity group
    - leaving activity group
    - Third party call to verify valid email address
- **DB/Login** - Stores users and groups in database. Database securely stores user login information. 
- **WebSocket** - As users join groups, their choice is shown to other users.
