## HTML Notes

The Web Father, Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web and HTML.

HTML is the bare-bones structure of a website. It's what creates the actual objects that are on the site: the text, the buttons, the images, etc. CSS is there to make this stuff look pretty.

## CSS Notes

HÃ¥kon Wium Lie created Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS. This makes webpages pretty, rather than just like documents. It's high-key pretty difficult to get it to work, but after while it gets there.

## JavaScript

Brendan Eich created JavaScript to make webpages interactive.

## React

We use react to update the page as variables change.

## Service

Creating a backend allows more capabilities to keep information.

## Mongo DB

Simple database to store json objects in. Easy to use, I like it.
